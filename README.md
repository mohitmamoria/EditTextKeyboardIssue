## HELP PLEASE!

I am trying to create a floating view (using WindowManager) that uses EditText Component. But here's the issue.

If I create the floating view using the `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE`, the keyboard doesn't open up when I focus on the Edittext Component by touching on it.

I tried removing the `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE` flag, and the keyboard shows up just fine. It works as expected. BUT. A BIG BUT. Not "Butt", but "But". But, the back button is broken now. Not only back button, but all of the touch screen. I am not able to touch the screen anywhere except the floating view. :( (I want to touch it everywhere!)

What can we do? Please help.
